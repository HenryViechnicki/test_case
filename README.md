Blairdle: A game like sardines

This game requires location permissions from your browser, and may not run in Safari.

The game is a completely immersive physical game, where players try to find a physical code written somewhere in the playing area (defined
prior to play) before the other players. Once players have entered the code, they have 7 seconds to run away. After that,
the player's location is pinned and visible to all players. The more people you beat to finding the code, the more points you are awarded
